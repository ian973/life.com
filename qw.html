<font size=4 color=red><b>RICK SANCHEZ</font></b><br>
is badass Because fundamentally Rick is miserable, he hates his life, and is continuously trying to perfect the perfect way to off himself.<br>
He is miserable because of his intelligence, stop for a moment an think of all the super intelligent people you have heard of have any of them ever been happy?<br><br>
Einstein and Hawking were serial cheaters who were never happy with their spouses or any of the women they slept with.<br>
Deep down Rick is such an ass to Morty because he envies his stupidity. Morty will get to have the life Rick wants one where there is surprise, happiness, and joy.<br><br>
Trust me there are worse things than being born dumb!<br>
He is over 300. "And considering his advancements in Science Fiction technology<br><br>
      <h2>MAD SCIENTIST</h2>

<font size=4 color=red><b>IRONMAN</font></b><br>
Tony Stark died at the end of 'Avengers: Endgame' but before that he saved the entire universe from Thanos<br>
and his forces by snapping them out of existence and ending their threat once and for all. But the use of all the six Infinity Stones<br>
all at once took its toll on his bodyand he died of his grievous injuries.30 Jul 2022<br><br>
iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons.<br>
The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions).<br>
Power scale: 9.5. Iron Man was the only Avenger able to injure Thanos in "Infinity War" (until Thor nearly killed him),<br>
and he did it when Thanos had already collected four Infinity Stones.<br>
He was also the only person Thanos knew by name, which is evidence of Iron Man's fearsome reputation.<br><br><br>
